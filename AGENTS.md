# AGENTS.md (Local-First)

Keep this file and `CLAUDE.md` aligned.

This repo is local-first now. Do not reintroduce hosted-service assumptions, remote deployment runbooks, or hardcoded production domains.

## Core guardrails

- Prefer local Mac runtime, local bridge, QR pairing, and daemon workflows.
- Be an intraprendente agent: proactively inspect local code, protocol/schema, and official sources to confirm facts before replying; do not repeatedly stop to ask for confirmation when the next verification step is safe and obvious.
- Keep repo isolation by thread/project metadata and local `cwd`.
- Do not reintroduce filtering by selected repo in sidebar/content.
- Keep cross-repo open/create flow with automatic local context switch.
- Preserve single responsibility: shared logic belongs in services/coordinators, not duplicated in views.
- Treat this repo as open source: avoid junk code, placeholder hacks, noisy one-off workarounds, and low-signal docs.
- If you touch docs, keep them local-only and remove stale hosted-service notes instead of adding compatibility layers.
- Do not create one-off report markdown files in the repo root (security reports, audit notes, scratch summaries, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks for a file. Keep ad-hoc analysis in the chat.
- For open-source/self-hosted safety, do not log live relay `sessionId` values or other bearer-like pairing identifiers in server logs; redact or hash them instead.
- Keep user-facing answers compact by default unless the user explicitly asks for more detail.

## iOS runtime + timeline guardrails

- `turn/started` may not include a usable `turnId`: keep the per-thread running fallback.
- If Stop is tapped and `activeTurnIdByThread` is missing, resolve via `thread/read` before interrupting.
- On reconnect/background recover, rehydrate active turn state so Stop remains visible.
- Suppress benign background disconnect noise (`NWError.posix(.ECONNABORTED)`) and retry on foreground.
- Keep assistant rows item-scoped to avoid timeline flattening/reordering.
- Merge late reasoning deltas into existing rows; do not spawn fake extra "Thinking..." rows.
- Ignore late turn-less activity events when the turn is already inactive.
- Preserve item-aware history reconciliation instead of falling back to `turnId`-only matching.

## Local connection guardrails

- Prefer saved relay pairing and local connection state as the source of truth.
- Avoid hardcoded remote domains; default to local values or explicit user config.
- Keep pairing/auth UX stable: do not clear saved relay info too early during reconnect flows.
- Preserve reconnect behavior across relaunch when the local host session is still valid.
- Preserve the QR/local-relay pairing path: do not regress the scanner -> saved pairing -> connect flow by letting onboarding/auto-reconnect race manual scan control.
- For local relay recovery, keep resumed desktop-thread live mirroring and rollout fallback logic intact so reopened/running threads still recover state even when the rollout file is older than the recent-candidate window.

## Build guardrails

- Do not run Xcode tests unless the user explicitly asks. Do not decide to run them on your own.
- Markdown files inside Xcode-synced groups can still produce harmless warnings.
- For small iOS/mobile fixes, prefer inspection and targeted edits over simulator runs by default.

## Model selection

Rankings, higher = better. Cost reflects what I actually pay (OpenAI is near-free for me due to a deal), not list price. Intelligence is how hard a problem you can hand the model unsupervised. Taste covers UI/UX, code quality, API design, and copy.

| model | cost | intelligence | taste |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| gpt-5.6-sol | 9 | 8 | 5 |
| sonnet-5 | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| opus-4.8 | 4 | 7 | 8 |
| fable-5 | 2 | 9 | 9 |

How to apply:

- These are defaults, not limits. You have standing permission to override them: if a cheaper model's output doesn't meet the bar, rerun or redo the work with a smarter model without asking. Judge the output, not the price tag. Escalating costs less than shipping mediocre work.
- Cost is a tie-breaker only; when axes conflict for anything that ships, intelligence > taste > cost.
- Don't let cost prevent you from using the right model for the job. Instead, take advantage of cheaper options to get more information and try things before moving the work to a more expensive option.
- Bulk/mechanical work (clear-spec implementation, data analysis, migrations): gpt-5.6-sol — it's effectively free.
- Anything user-facing (UI, copy, API design) needs taste >= 7.
- Reviews of plans/implementations: fable-5 or opus-4.8, optionally gpt-5.6-sol as an extra independent perspective.
- Never use Haiku.
- Mechanics: gpt-5.6-sol is only reachable through the Codex CLI — `codex exec` / `codex review` (my `~/.codex/config.toml` defaults to gpt-5.6-sol). Use the codex-implementation, codex-review, and codex-computer-use skills; for work they don't cover (investigation, data analysis), run `codex exec -s read-only` directly with a self-contained prompt.
- Claude models (sonnet-5, opus-4.8, fable-5) run via the Agent/Workflow model parameter.

Using gpt-5.5 inside workflows and subagents (the model parameter only takes Claude models, so use a wrapper):

- Spawn a thin Claude wrapper agent with `model: 'sonnet', effort: 'low'` whose prompt instructs it to write a self-contained codex prompt, run `codex exec` via Bash, and return the report (use `schema` on the wrapper to get structured output back).
- Always label these agents with a `gpt-5.6-sol:` prefix, e.g. `{label: 'gpt-5.6-sol:review-auth'}` — the workflow UI shows the wrapper's Claude model, so the label is the only indication the real worker is gpt-5.6-sol.
- Codex runs can exceed Bash's 10-minute timeout: pass an explicit timeout, or run in the background and poll for the report file.
- Parallel gpt-5.6-sol implementation agents must use `isolation: 'worktree'` so codex edits don't collide in the shared checkout.
- Workflow token budgets only count Claude tokens; codex work is free and invisible to `budget.spent()`.

## Long-running gpt-5.6-sol tasks

gpt-5.6-sol is exceptionally capable on long-running tasks. Give it substantial, multi-step work when it is a good fit; do not artificially split a coherent task merely to make it shorter.

- The quality of the result depends on the quality of the prompt. Give it a detailed, self-contained brief: the objective, relevant context, constraints, expected outputs, files or systems in scope, acceptance criteria, and the verification required.
- State important invariants and non-goals explicitly. Do not assume it can infer project-specific constraints that are not in the prompt or the repository instructions.
- For complex work, ask it to inspect the current state, implement the full solution, run proportionate verification, and report concrete results and remaining risks.
- Prefer one well-scoped, detailed prompt over a vague prompt followed by many corrective iterations.
