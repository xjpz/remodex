# Contributing to Remodex

I am not actively accepting contributions right now.

This project is very early. Things change fast, priorities shift, and I'm still figuring out the right direction. If you open a PR or issue, there's a good chance I close it, defer it, or never get to it. That's not personal — I just need to stay focused.

## If you still want to contribute

Read this whole file first.

### What I'm most likely to accept

- Small, focused bug fixes
- Small reliability or performance improvements
- Typo and documentation fixes

### What I'm least likely to accept

- Large PRs
- Drive-by feature work
- Opinionated rewrites or refactors
- Scope expansion I didn't ask for

### Before opening a PR

- **Open an issue first** for anything non-trivial. Describe the problem, not your solution.
- Keep changes minimal. One fix per PR.
- Explain exactly what changed and exactly why.
- If it touches UI, include a screenshot or video.

Opening a PR does not create an obligation on my side. I may close it. I may ignore it. I may take the idea and implement it differently. That's how early-stage projects work.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** installed and working
- **[Codex desktop app](https://openai.com/index/codex/)** (optional — for viewing threads on Mac)
- **macOS** (required for desktop refresh; core bridge works on any OS)
- **Xcode 16+** (only for building the iOS app)
- **iPhone** with the Remodex app (or built from source)

### Bridge setup

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Emanuele-web04/remodex.git
cd remodex

# Start a local relay + bridge together
./run-local-remodex.sh
```

This launcher:
1. Spawns a Codex `app-server` process
2. Starts a local relay on `/relay/{sessionId}`
3. Points the bridge at that relay
4. Prints a QR code in your terminal for the initial trust bootstrap

For a temporary public tunnel to that local relay, start the tunnel in one terminal:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Then pass the generated URL to the launcher in another terminal:

```sh
./run-local-remodex.sh --relay-url https://<random>.trycloudflare.com
```

If you only want the bridge process:

```sh
cd phodex-bridge
npm install
REMODEX_RELAY="ws://localhost:9000/relay" npm start
```

That runs `remodex up`, which:
1. Spawns a Codex `app-server` process
2. Connects to the configured relay
3. On macOS, starts the built-in background bridge service
4. Prints a QR code in your terminal when first-time pairing or recovery is needed

Scan the QR code with the Remodex iOS app to trust that Mac.

### iOS app setup

```sh
cd CodexMobile
open CodexMobile.xcodeproj
```

1. Select your team in **Signing & Capabilities** (you'll need an Apple Developer account)
2. Pick a target device (physical iPhone or simulator)
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

The app uses SwiftUI and the current project target is iOS 18.6. No CocoaPods or SPM dependencies — it's a standalone Xcode project.

### Testing a full local session

1. Start the local launcher: `./run-local-remodex.sh`
2. Open the iOS app and scan the QR code
3. Create a new thread from the app
4. Send a message — you should see Codex respond in real-time
5. Try git operations from the phone (commit, push, branch switching)
6. Reopen the app and verify that the trusted reconnect path is used instead of forcing a fresh QR immediately

### Environment variables

For OSS/local development, prefer the launcher above. If you want to point the bridge process at your own relay manually without the launcher, export `REMODEX_RELAY` in your shell:

```sh
# Connect to an existing Codex instance instead of spawning one
REMODEX_CODEX_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:8080 npm start

# Use your own self-hosted relay endpoint (`ws://` is unencrypted)
REMODEX_RELAY="ws://localhost:9000/relay" npm start

# Enable auto-refresh of Codex.app on Mac
REMODEX_REFRESH_ENABLED=true npm start
```

### Code style

- **Bridge**: CommonJS, no transpilation, no TypeScript. Keep it simple.
- **iOS**: SwiftUI, async/await, MainActor isolation. Follow existing patterns.
- No linter or formatter is enforced — just match what's already there.

### Trust model

- The first QR pairing is possession-based: it contains the relay URL and a live session ID.
- After that first handshake, the iPhone stores a trusted Mac record and can ask the relay for the Mac's current live session again.
- Set `REMODEX_RELAY` to a relay you control when you are not using the local launcher, or pass the relay URL to the launcher with `--relay-url`. Use `wss://` when you want TLS in transit.
- Remodex uses an authenticated end-to-end encrypted transport after pairing completes. The relay code is public for inspection, but deployed relay details should stay in private config.
- The built-in daemon / background service path is currently macOS-only. Linux and Windows can still run the bridge, but contributors should treat the daemon logic as platform-specific.
